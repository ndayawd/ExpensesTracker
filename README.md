# Reflection
There were some challenges in the project including coding, and especially working around GitHub. We initially struggled with branching and merging, but in the end, we researched online and pushed through with the challenges. Our group found out that we enjoyed collaborative coding. Although it took some time to get used to GitHub, we improved our communication and established a clear workflow, collaborative coding became more productive and rewarding.
